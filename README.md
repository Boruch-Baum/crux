# crux

A **C**ollection of **R**idiculously **U**seful e**X**tensions for Emacs.
crux bundles a few useful interactive commands to enhance your
overall Emacs experience.

## Installation

Available on all major `package.el` community maintained repos -
[MELPA Stable][] and [MELPA][] repos.

MELPA Stable is recommended as it has the latest stable version.
MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
don't want to run from a git checkout.

You can install `crux` using the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] crux [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'crux)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'crux))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

Add the following to your Emacs config to enable
`crux`:

```el
(crux-setup-default-keybindings)
```

## Keybindings

individual commands to whatever keybindings you prefer.
